The app sizes about 10 MB, but if you are worried about the source trust, you can use and run the plain Python script provided.

Some Python libraries need to be installed to run the Python file. [Not the .exe] 
(Libraries Command file is attached)

Any bug reports and glich complaints are welcomed !
